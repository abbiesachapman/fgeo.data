  Hi Mauro,

Attached please find:

  1. The complete ViewTaxonomy table.
2. One hectare of data for hectare: px>=700 and px<800 and py>=100 and py<200. The data includes only those records from census 2005 and census 2010.
3. 1000 randomly chosen trees from the whole plot. I only included data from census 2005 and census 2010.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Suzanne
