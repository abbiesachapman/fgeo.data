#' General description of a ViewFullTable (vft).
#'
#' Reproduced from \url{http://bit.ly/vft-definitions}:
#' > _ViewFullTable_ table. Merges all the relevant variables from the
#' corresponding tables in the database back into a flat file. Each record
#' represents one measurement and/or attribute of one stem of one tree of one
#' plot from one census. Because buttresses can grow, for trees with buttresses,
#' a stem may be measured at more than one height. So some stems may have more
#' than one measurement in a census, but at different hom.
