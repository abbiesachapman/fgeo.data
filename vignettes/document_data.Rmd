## Documenting datasets

This section sets conventions to document datasets in the __fgeo.data__ package. This makes it easier to understand the existing datasets and provides some structure to facilitate the expansion of __fgeo.data__.

### Documenting generic datasets

Generic datasets (e.g. ViwFullTable) should have these components:

* A short nickname for the generic table (e.g. vft). If the name is already short (e.g. stem), use the full name (e.g. stem). These are some conventional generic names and nicknames:
    * ViewFullTable: vft.
    * ViewTaxonomy: taxa.
    * tree or full: tree.
    * stem: stem.
    * tree and stem, collectively: census.

* A help file `generic_description` with the following (e.g. `?`[vft_description](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.data/reference/vft_description.html)):
    * A generic description that applies to any similar dataset, from any ForestGEO site.
    * A section `@seealso`, linking to specific datasets and to the [data_dictionary].

### Documenting specific datasets

Datasets from a specific site should be named with the format `site_generic_info`:

* `site` should be a single string uniquely identifying your site among all other sites in the ForestGEO network; it may be a well know nickname (e.g. bci). 
* `generic` should be one of the same as in _`generic`_`_description`. 

* `info` should be a single short string indicating the most prominent characteristic of the specific dataset -- commonly referring to the criteria used to subset a larger dataset (e.g. `bci_stem6_random`).

For example, if your data comes from Barro Colorado Island, and it is a ViewFullTable containing a random subset of a few trees, a good name for it would be `bci_vft_random`. This format works well with auto-completion in RStudio.

The documentation of `site_generic_info` should include the following (e.g. `?`[bci_vft_random](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.data/reference/vft_bci.html)):

* A specific description that applies to this particular dataset.
* A section `@seealso`, linking to `generic_description` and to the [data_dictionary].
* A section `@examples` showing the structure of `site_generic_info`.
